## Change Invalid CSS to Valid CSS

## Steps 
In this lesson, we will be taking the invalid CSS in `css/style.css` and changing it to be valid.
1. Click the "OPEN" button. 
2. Open index.html in your browser. Notice how our styles don't look quite right? 
3. Open css/style.css in your text editor.
4. Visit the W3C CSS validator [http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input). If not already selected, click on the tab labeled "By direct input".
5. Copy the code from css/style.css and paste it into the text area. Click the "Check" button.
6. Use the error messages to correct the CSS. 
7. Repeat steps 3-5 until your readout states "Congratulations! No Error Found.".

Remember to check your progress in `index.html` in your browser!

## Conclusion

With a CSS validator, you can work your way through cleaning up errors in a CSS document and reduce the likelihood of display errors across platforms. Using the W3C CSS validator will help you quickly and efficiently troubleshoot your CSS.
